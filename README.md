# hackclub-invite-screener
Invites or denies new requests to join the Hack Club Slack

When someone fills out the form to request to join the Slack on [hackclub.com](https://hackclub.com), it posts a message to a private channel called #invite-screener, where we can send an invitation or deny the request with a click of a button.

Code that handles the form data & posts the message [can be found here](https://github.com/hackclub/v3/blob/master/pages/api/join.js).
